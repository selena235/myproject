                        <br><br>For many people, the decision to owning their housing is a deliberate, reasoned choice.<br>
                         One reason may be because they can afford to buy a house,equally important reasons why they may choose to rent: s Renting lets people stay mobile and move away when work is available elsewhere, without being tied down to any particular place or to regular house payments.
                          buying gives people ﬂexibility in how they manage their household budgets, moving to cheaper housing when times are hard and to better housing, when their incomes increase, or freeing up more of their earnings for more essential needs like food, education, medical care or emergencies. 
                          buying suits people during transitory periods of their lives, when they are not yet ready to settle down in one place.

                        <br>is often hard to distinguish rental housing from owner-occupied hous-ing.
                         Even in large purpose-built rental complexes, some units may get sold off to individual owners. 
                         There are people renting in densely built old city quar-ters, in public housing estates, in hous-ing schemes for civil servants, in private sector subdivisions and condominiums. 
                         There are also many renters in slums and squatter settlements, in peri-urban land subdivisions and in semi-rural com-muter settlements

                       <br><br> Housing access based on occupation: Construction labourers are often provid-ed with basic housing on the construc-tion site, domestic workers often stay with their employers and 
                        factory work-ers are sometimes provided with hous-ing near the factory. Some government jobs also come with rental or rent-free accommodation.
                        buying is convenient for households who may not want to make the long-term ﬁnancial commitment that comes with buying a house, or to face the long-term costs involved in repairing and maintaining their own house. 
                        buying allows people to send more of their city earnings home to relatives, or to invest in buying land or building a house or business back in the village.
